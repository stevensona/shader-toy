- This repository vendors the minified build above as resources/animation-timeline.min.js.
- Normal extension webviews load the vendored copy from extension resources.
- Standalone webviews may load the CDN URL above (see src/extensions/packages/animation_timeline_js_extension.ts).
- Do not patch/modify the vendored widget file directly. Customizations are done from our webview code
  (e.g. setting options, attaching event handlers, DOM overlays, and/or runtime method overrides).
